# Custom Mods

This folder is for custom mods made by our resident coding maestro, JeffPeng.

* JMOD: Called "si.core" at this time, this is the mod that handles tool and block properties, adds alloying recipes, and allows expanded mining progression without the need for Iguana's Tinker Tweaks.  This mod also currently introduces a "Backyard Metalcasting" mechanic, implementing crucible-and-mold smelting and crafting of alloy ingots (just ingots, no tools), and provides alloying recipes for the RotaryCraft blast furnace... including low-grade steel production.
* Flint Chisel: Since iron is significantly higher in the mining progression, a lower-durability flint chisel has been added to allow the chiseling of blocks for early-game decoration.
* Igniter: Due to the removal of Tinker's Construct, a replacement for the Tinker's Mechworks igniter was requested.  This is that replacement.
* matmos folder: Unlike most configurations, matmos keeps its configurations stored in the "mods" folder instead of the "config" folder.  This specific folder contains the configuration to disable player character sounds; the player will not scream when on fire or in lava.
